<h5>GIS Technician</h5>
- Demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy in researching data before application onto Apple maps. Pilot new data editing projects. QA/QC spatial information received from various vendors for implementation into Apple s mapping software program. Analyze and validate data content and assemble new content from various sources, including databases, files/spreadsheets and websites.
Responsible for content analysis, content analysis, validation, cleansing, collection and reporting.
Analyze base-map data, data specifications, and metadata for development of workflow instructions. Draft and coordinate dissemination of editing and sourcing policies.

<h5>GIS Analyst/Developer</h5>
- Create Leasehold competitor maps of areas held by Piedra and other oil companies within the Midland and Delaware basin as well as responsible for updating mineral holding maps within both areas utilizing Drilling info’s ArcGIS server. Responsible for creation of automated functionality of different geoprocessing tools within ArcGIS Server in the maintenance and periodic updating of leasehold competitor and mineral layers deriving information from DI and other 3rd party resources. Developed an in-house application through ArcGIS Application Builder tool that easily queries Permit, Well, DUC info directly from DI’s live feature service layers to display real time activity as well as allows access to features stored in the organization ArcGIS online portal. Such as leasehold competitor and future prospect acreage and includes a prospect template for landman to easily map future prospects and store them on their own respective user accounts. Developed Object detection framework using Pytorch, fastai, and Jupyter Notebooks through AWS machine learning environment and trained it to detect tanks on well pads through satellite imagery, the resulting frozen inference graph is then fed into Detect Objects using Deeplearning geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro to then generate shapefiles for all detected features in any given extent.
